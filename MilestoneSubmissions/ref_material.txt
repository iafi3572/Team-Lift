  Prompt: How to get this button to close the modal it is currently in before opening the new one <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-      
  target="#edit_modal_{{@index}}">Edit Workout</button>

  Response: If you want the button to close the current modal and open another, you can do it purely with Bootstrap's data attributes — with a little trick:

  Unfortunately, Bootstrap doesn’t support switching modals directly with data-bs-* alone. But you can work around this by:
  
  ✅ Adding data-bs-dismiss="modal" to the button
  This closes the current modal.
  
  Then use a little delay trick using setTimeout in a one-liner onclick, if you're okay with just one line of inline JS.

  Best alternative with no external JS files:
  If you're okay with onclick="..." inline just for modal switching, the earlier solution using:
  
  html
  Copy
  Edit
  <button data-bs-dismiss="modal" onclick="setTimeout(() => bootstrap.Modal.getOrCreateInstance(document.querySelector('#edit_modal_{{@index}}')).show(), 500)">Edit Workout</button>
  is the cleanest and most Bootstrap-compliant way to go.
  
  Let me know if you'd accept a minimal inline JS workaround, or if you're building this with a framework like React or Vue — there are even cleaner ways depending on that.
